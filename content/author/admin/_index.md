I am an engineer from *École nationale supérieure d'informatique et de
mathématiques appliquées* currently working as a data science consultant for
Schneider Electric. I received a Ph.D. in statistical modeling applied to
genomics and epidemiology from *Université Grenoble Alpes* in 2017. During the
last year have been involved in the organization of the Data Science
competitions launched by Schneider Electric in collaboration with DrivenData.

I am a technology enthusiast, I am particularly interested in domotic and data
science. But when I am not on my computer I do sport. My favorite sports are
kyokushinkai karate and trail running but I like practicing every mountain
sport.
