We propose a solution of the DrivenData competition [Power Laws
Optimization](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/53/optimize-photovoltaic-battery/).
The objective of the competition was to create an optimization algorithm that
effectively uses available solar power, building energy consumption, and a
battery system to buy, sell, and consume energy in the way that saves the most
money and puts the least demand on the energy grid.
